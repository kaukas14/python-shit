# Patarimai su if ciklu
# 1. Every if statement must have an else.
# 2. If this else should never run because it doest make sense then you must use a die function
# in the else that prints out an error message and dies, just like we did in the last exercise. This will find many errors.
# 3. Never nest if statements more than two deep and always try to do them one deep.
# 4. Treat if-statements like paragraphs where each if-elif-else grouping is like a set of sentences. Put blank lines before and after 
# 5. Your boolean test should be simple. If they are complex, move their calculations to variables earlier in your function and use a good name for the variable.

# 1. Use while loop only yo loop forever and that mean probably never. This only applies to Python; other languages are different.
# 2. Use a for-loop for all other kinds of looping especially if there is a fixed or limited number of things to loop over.

# 1. Do not use a "debugger". A debugger is like doing a full body scan on a sick person. You do not get any specific useful information
# and you find a whole lot of information that doesnt help and is just confusing.
# 2. The best way to debug a program is to use print to print out the values of variables at points in the program to see where they go wrong.
# 3. Make sure parts of your programs work as you work on them. Do not write massive files of code before you try to run them. Code a little, run a little, fix a little.
